## MultiLayer Perceptron to classify Handwritten digits using TensorFlow

Implemented a Multi layer perceptron to accurately classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset with 97% accuracy

Used RELU activation function for the hidden layers and used Softmax activation function for the output layer

The below are the parameters that are used in training the neural networks
* Optimization algorithm: Adams
* No of Hidden layers:2
* No of Epochs: 15
* learning_rate = 0.001 
* batch_size : 100
